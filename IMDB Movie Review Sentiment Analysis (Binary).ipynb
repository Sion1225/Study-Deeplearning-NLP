I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.\n",

As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.\n",

I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids.

I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).\"\"\""

This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli.
